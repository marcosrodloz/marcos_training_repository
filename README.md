The contents of this repository are intended to be used by the owner of the repository and to serve as reference to anybody that has access to it. The purpose of this repository is to contain the work/projects/assignments of any training related to data engineering, science or analysis that I have participated.
My sole intent is to showcase few things that I've done. While they are far from being perfect, I decided to start collecting them as I complete them. I expect that at some point, I will be able to show an improvement not only from my first attempts, but also on the development of each one. 

If you have reached this point, I want to thank you for reading all this. If you have any suggestion or recommendation, please feel free to give it to me, it will be much appreciated :)
